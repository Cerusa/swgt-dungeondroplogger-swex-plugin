# swgt-dungeondroplogger-swex-plugin
To use this plugin, simply drop into your SWEX plugins folder. If you don't know where this folder is, if you go to settings, under "Files Path" is where your plugins folder will be. So for example if your "Files Path" is D:\SWEX then your plugins folder will be D:\SWEX\plugins. If the folder doesn't exist, create it and put the SWGTDungeonDropLogger.asar file into the folder. If you are running SWEX 0.0.62, SWEX will automatically keep the SWGT Dungeon Drop Logger up to date everytime you start SWEX.
